Contents of the Repository

1. Classes Folder  
This folder contains all the `.cpp` and `.h` files written by me to implement the game logic. These files include the code for:  
- Enemy AIs (Rat, Cat, Lynx)  
- Game mechanics (music box, flashlight, etc.)  
- Night progression and event handling  

2. Resources Folder  
This folder contains all the necessary assets for the game, such as:  
- Images (sprites, backgrounds, UI elements, etc.)  
- Sounds (effects, music tracks)  
- Fonts (used for in-game text)

3. SilentThreats Folder  
This folder is the full project directory generated by the Cocos2d-x engine. It contains:  
- The **Classes** and **Resources** folders already integrated.  
- Additional files and configurations created by Cocos2d-x.  
- A `.sln` file for opening the project directly in Visual Studio, the `.sln` is located in the folder proj.win32.  

4. Video Explanation and Gameplay  
Included is a video that explains:  
   - The objective of the game.  
   - The controls and mechanics.  
   - Enemy behaviors and how to defend against them.

Usage Instructions

Option 1: View or Modify the Code Only  
If you want to explore or use only the code I wrote, follow these steps:  
1. Download the `Classes` and `Resources` folders from the repository.  
2. Create a new Cocos2d-x project on your computer.  
   - Use the Cocos2d-x command line tools or any IDE setup for Cocos2d-x.  
3. Replace the newly created project's `Classes` and `Resources` folders with the ones you downloaded.  
4. Build and run the project to see the game in action.  

Option 2: Work with the Full Project (Recommended)  
If you want to work with the exact same setup I used:  
1. Download the `SilentThreats` folder from the repository.  
2. Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio (or the corresponding IDE for your operating system).  
3. Ensure Cocos2d-x is correctly installed and configured on your system.  
4. Build and run the project from Visual Studio.
